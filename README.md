### 1. [Analyze International Debt Statistics](https://github.com/NabillaAizuddin/SQL-Projects/blob/6c063dc0fee70d9b984d30f965abf746339a2c90/notebook.ipynb)

### 2. [The Golden Age of Video Games](https://github.com/NabillaAizuddin/SQL-Projects/blob/fa71921f6a5ef1105c215a38990104d24355aaac/notebook.md)

I had utilize my fundamental knowledge in SQL through these project.
+ These projects are completed using key SQL functions such as:

  -```SUM()```
  -```MAX()```
  -```WHERE```
  -```GROUP BY```
  -```ORDER BY```
  -```LIMIT``` 
  -```WHERE```

### 3. [Optimizing Online Sports Retail Revenue](https://github.com/NabillaAizuddin/SQL-Projects/blob/c3fb7f0d3f674e2786768135278af61de0cb290c/notebook.ipynb)

For this third project, I learnt to utilized the data to:
  + Analyse the variety of listing prices and count the number of product under each listing prices using
***```SELECT```,```COUNT()```, ```FROM```, ```INNER JOIN```, ```WHERE```, ```GROUP BY```, ```ORDER BY```***
  
  + Create labels for products grouped by price range and brand using a ```CASE WHEN``` statement.
    
  + Calculate the average discount offered by brand using ```HAVING```.
  
  + Calculate the correlation between reviews and revenue using ```corr(table1.column1, table2.column2)```.
  
  + Find the ratings and reviews by product description length using ```TRUNC``` and convert data type ```column::numeric``` OR ```column::integer```.
  
  + Count the number of reviews per brand per month using ```DATE_PART('month', column) AS month```
  
  + Create CTE ```WITH ___ AS```
  
  + Calculate median using ```percentile_disc(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY column)```.
  
  + Use ```WHERE ___ NOT IN``` to filter the items not in the CTE.
  
### 4. [Analyzing NYC Public School Test Result Scores](https://github.com/NabillaAizuddin/SQL-Projects/blob/3f6c143633f6ffb711f1dcd4eacb3626f7b11ba6/notebook.ipynb)

  + Use aggregate functions such as ```MAX```, ```MIN```, ```SUM``` to analyzed which school has the highest score in SAT writing, math, and reading respectively.
  
  + Use ```GROUP BY``` to find the total of SAT scores according to borough and school name.
  
  + Other functions used in this fourth project are:
        - ```SELECT```
        - ```FROM```
        - ```WHERE```
        -```GROUP BY```
        -```ORDER BY```
        -```LIMIT```
